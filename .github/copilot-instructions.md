# FORD ‚Ä¢ Copilot Instructions

> Single-Player 2D Dungeon Crawler in **Python + Arcade** (Roguelike Pixel 16√ó16‚Üí64px).
> Goal: **clean architecture**, **data-driven content**, **tests for everything**, **60 FPS feel**, **zero custom art** (CC0 placeholders only).

---

## TL;DR (Golden Rules)

1. **Always ship tests** with every code change (`pytest`). No tests ‚Üí no merge.
2. **Keep logic testable**: core systems (skills, loot, crafting, AI) must not depend on Arcade/OpenGL.
3. **Follow style**: Ruff + Black clean; type hints everywhere; small functions; no God objects.
4. **Data-driven**: JSON for items/skills/recipes/monsters/loot-tables must be validated at load time.
5. **Pixel-perfect**: integer scaling, no sub-pixel movement; stable 60 FPS feel.
6. **Git hygiene**: feature branches, Conventional Commits, small PRs, green CI before merge.
7. **No new artwork**: use CC0 placeholders; record sources in `ATTRIBUTIONS.md`.
8. **Determinism for tests**: use `PYTHONHASHSEED=0` and seeded RNG for logic.
9. **Document tasks**: keep `docs/task.md` updated with all active and completed tasks.

## Project Constraints (enforced by Copilot)

- **Python**: 3.12+ (via Conda environment `ford`)
- **Arcade**: ‚â• 3.x
- **Package**: Poetry
- **Resolution**: 1920√ó1080, integer scale (16px tiles upscale 4√ó ‚Üí 64px).
- **Layers**: ground, walls (collidable), decals, light-blockers, entities.
- **Rendering**: SpriteList per layer + Arcade lights & particles.
- **Physics**: AABB, dt movement (8-way), no slopes.
- **Combat**: **Turn-based** resolution (formula-driven attack/defense/effects).
- **Systems**: skills (usage-based), professions/nodes, crafting (JSON recipes), loot tables, save/load.

---

## Local Workflow (VS Code + Conda)

- **Environment**: `conda activate ford` (Python 3.12)
- Use provided `.vscode`:
  - **Run**: `Run FORD` (launches `python -m game.main`)
  - **Tasks**: `poetry: install`, `run`, `tests`
- Formatter/linter run on save (Black + Ruff).
- Tiled is used to edit `.tmx` maps (external app).

### üéØ CRITICAL FOR AGENTS: Use Tasks, Not `run_in_terminal`

**All long-running commands MUST use `.vscode/tasks.json` tasks via the `runTasks` tool, NOT raw terminal!**

**Why:** VS Code Shell Integration has known timing/buffering issues. Tasks guarantee proper completion detection and exit-code capture.

**Available tasks:**
- `pytest: run all` - Full test suite (ALWAYS use this, never raw pytest)
- `pytest: run fast (no slow tests)` - Quick smoke tests
- `pytest: run with coverage` - Coverage report
- `ruff: check all` - Linting (no auto-fix)
- `ruff: fix all` - Auto-fix lint issues
- `black: format all` - Format code
- `pre-commit: run all` - Run all pre-commit hooks
- `run: FORD game` - Start the game
- `poetry: install` - Install deps
- `test: full suite` - Lint + test + coverage (compound)

**USAGE FOR AGENTS:**
```
Use: runTasks with label "pytest: run all"
NOT: run_in_terminal with "pytest tests/"

Use: runTasks with label "ruff: check all"
NOT: run_in_terminal with "ruff check ."
```

**Do NOT use raw terminal for:**
- ‚ùå pytest/tests
- ‚ùå ruff/black/lint
- ‚ùå pre-commit hooks
- ‚ùå poetry install/update
- ‚ùå Long-running builds/servers

### Commands (Poetry with Conda)
```bash
conda activate ford
poetry install --no-root
poetry run python -m game.main          # run
poetry run pytest -q                    # tests
poetry run pytest -q -m "not slow"      # default fast suite
poetry run ruff check . && poetry run ruff format .
