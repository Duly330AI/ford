# 🔧 FIX SUMMARY: Conda Auto-Activation & CONTRIBUTING Consolidation

**Date:** October 26, 2025  
**Commit:** 25da9ac  
**Status:** ✅ **COMPLETE & PUSHED**

---

## ✅ ISSUE 1: CONDA AUTO-ACTIVATION

### Problem
- Conda environment not auto-activating when terminal starts
- `pre-commit`, `poetry`, `pytest` not available
- Users had to manually: `conda activate ford`

### Root Cause
Git Bash was not initialized for Conda. Required: `conda init bash` (one-time setup)

### Solution Implemented

**Part 1: Updated dev.sh**
- Added auto-detect for conda base path
- Tries multiple conda path locations (Windows/macOS/Linux)
- Auto-sources conda initialization script
- Auto-activates 'ford' environment
- Fallback activation if first attempt fails

**Part 2: Updated .vscode/settings.json**
- Added `CONDA_AUTO_ACTIVATE` environment variable
- Git Bash already configured with `--login -i` flags
- Settings persist across terminal restarts

**Part 3: One-Time User Setup**
```bash
# Run once to initialize conda for bash
conda init bash

# Then close and reopen VS Code terminal
# Now dev.sh will auto-activate ford environment
```

### How It Works Now

**Before:**
```bash
$ source dev.sh
⚠️ Conda environment not active
  Run: conda activate ford
```

**After (after `conda init bash` + terminal restart):**
```bash
$ source dev.sh
✅ FORD development environment loaded
   Conda: ford (active)
   Type dev-help for available commands
```

### User Instructions

1. **One-time setup (in any terminal):**
   ```bash
   conda init bash
   # Then close ALL terminals and reopen
   ```

2. **Now in new terminal:**
   ```bash
   cd /path/to/ford
   source dev.sh
   # ✅ Conda auto-activates to 'ford'
   # ✅ pre-commit, poetry, pytest available
   ```

3. **Verify:**
   ```bash
   dev-status      # Shows environment status
   pre-commit --version   # ✅ Works
   poetry --version       # ✅ Works
   pytest --version       # ✅ Works
   ```

## ✅ ISSUE 2: CONTRIBUTING.MD CONSOLIDATION

### Problem
- CONTRIBUTING.md existed in TWO places:
  - Root: `CONTRIBUTING.md` (362 lines, comprehensive)
  - docs: `docs/CONTRIBUTING.md` (30 lines, old/abgespeckt)
- Redundant and scattered documentation
- README linked to root version instead of docs/

### Solution Implemented

**Step 1: Compared both versions**
```
Root CONTRIBUTING.md:     362 lines ✅ (comprehensive)
docs/CONTRIBUTING.md:     30 lines  ❌ (abgespeckt/incomplete)
```

**Step 2: Consolidated**
- Moved comprehensive version (362 lines) to docs/CONTRIBUTING.md
- Deleted redundant root version
- Single source of truth in docs/

**Step 3: Updated references**
- Updated README.md to link to `docs/CONTRIBUTING.md`
- Git properly tracks file move/consolidation

### Result

```
BEFORE:
├── CONTRIBUTING.md           (362 lines, root)
├── docs/CONTRIBUTING.md      (30 lines, old)

AFTER:
├── docs/CONTRIBUTING.md      (362 lines, consolidated)
   (root version deleted)
```

### Documentation Structure Now

All developer documentation in `docs/`:
```
docs/
├── CONTRIBUTING.md           (How to contribute)
├── DEVELOPMENT.md            (Setup & workflow)
├── AUDIO_SYSTEM.md           (Audio architecture)
├── ARCHITECTURE_UO_ADDENDUM.md
├── COMBAT_RULES.md
├── task.md
└── tasks/
    └── TASK-M4-AUDIO-00-Completed.md
```
