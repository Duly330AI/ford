# Phase 11 – Master Task Integration Report

## Overview

All 11 TODO gaps have dedicated task coverage spanning magic, dungeon biomes, economy, itemization, quests, input, audio, tutorial, localization, documentation, and integration planning. Tasks follow project conventions (data-driven, deterministic, zero Arcade in systems) and reference relevant design docs.

## Phase Breakdown

### Phase 0 – Gap Analysis
- codex_outputs/phase0_gap_master_plan.md catalogues priorities, milestones, and dependencies.
- codex_outputs/phase0_dependency_graph.md visualizes cross-system relationships.

### Phase 1 – Magic System
- Four new tasks cover core system, spell data/schema, formulas, and cast integration.
- Spellbook UI updated to depend on backend; magic parameters moved to data.

### Phase 2 – Dungeon Biomes
- Introduced biome manager, room tagging, threat spawner, and debug tooling tasks.
- Added biome content alignment follow-up (TASK-M1-GEN-04) in Phase 10 for lore consistency.

### Phase 3 – Economy & Vendors
- Core economy, vendor schema, and restock tasks established with Merchant UI dependency updates.

### Phase 4 – Procedural Itemization
- Affix generator, affix schema, material/quality, and uniques/sets tasks created; loot tables updated to call generator.

### Phase 5 – Quest System
- Quest engine, schema, and event bus tasks defined, with save schema and HUD journal referencing new flows.

### Phase 6 – Advanced Input
- Context manager, controls schema, rebinding UI, and gamepad support tasks added; base input task preps migration.

### Phase 7 – Audio System
- Mixer, context rules, and advanced audio tasks documented; audio hooks task directs calls through mixer APIs.

### Phase 8 – Tutorial & FTUE
- Character creation, tutorial manager, overlay, scripted events, and content data tasks provided; save schema already captures tutorial flags.

### Phase 9 – Localization
- Localization service, validation tooling, and CI integration tasks added; UI tasks updated to rely on localization keys.

### Phase 10 – Documentation & World Alignment
- docs/ART_STYLE_GUIDE.md authored with production standards.
- TASK-M1-GEN-04 ensures biome content aligns with WORLD_BIBLE factions and loot signatures.

### Phase 11 – Reporting
- This master report plus dependency graph, roadmap, and statistics complete the integration deliverable.

## Integration Highlights

- Magic, quest, tutorial, and UI tasks now share consistent data interfaces and event bus contracts.
- Biome and world bible documentation cross-reference ensures encounter/loot alignment.
- Localization foundation ties into UI/tutor tasks, preparing for future multilingual support.
- Economy and itemization tasks coordinate through data-driven modifiers and restock mechanics.
