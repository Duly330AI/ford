## 📖 **Phase 2: Intro & Context (1 min)**

### **Narration (Skippable)**

**Text overlay on black screen:**

>
> *You have no past here, only a future to carve with sword and spell. The Abbey needs defenders. Will you answer the call?"*

**Audio:** Ambient wind, distant bell toll, somber music

**Duration:** 20-30 seconds (ESC to skip)

### **Fade In: Abbey Infirmary**

**Scene:**

**Dialogue:**

```

[Player auto-stands, faces NPC]

Brother Alaric: "The world beyond is treacherous. Undead stir in the old crypt.
                 We need brave souls like you."

[Tutorial Prompt: "Press W/A/S/D or Arrow Keys to move"]

Brother Alaric: "Explore the courtyard. Speak with Sister Elena when you're ready.

---

## 🌍 **Phase 7: Free Exploration (Ongoing)**

- ✅ Engage with crafting (future feature)

### **Optional Tutorial Hints (Contextual):**

- **First Skill Cap:** "You've reached 100 in [Skill]! This is the maximum."
- **First Quest Choice:** "Some quests have multiple outcomes. Choose wisely."

---

## 🎓 **Tutorial Design Principles**

### **DO:**

✅ **Show, don't tell** - Let players DO the action, not just read about it
✅ **One concept at a time** - Movement → Inventory → Combat (sequential)
✅ **Contextual prompts** - Only show hints when relevant
✅ **Allow failure** - Player can die in tutorial (respawn at Abbey)
✅ **Respect agency** - Let players skip/ignore optional content
✅ **Celebrate wins** - Positive feedback on first victory

### **DON'T:**

❌ **Wall of text** - No multi-paragraph tutorials
❌ **Forced reading** - All text skippable (ESC)
❌ **Hand-holding** - No forced optimal paths
❌ **Interruptions** - Don't pause gameplay for popups
❌ **Repetition** - Only explain once, trust player memory

## 🧪 **Testing the FTUE**

### **Playtesting Checklist:**

- [ ] Observe new player (user study)

### **A/B Testing Ideas:**

| Variant | Test | Hypothesis |
|---------|------|------------|
| **Intro Length** | 30s vs 60s narration | Shorter = less drop-off |
| **Combat Difficulty** | Skeleton HP 30 vs 50 | Easier = higher completion |
| **Prompt Frequency** | Every action vs key moments only | Less intrusive = better |
| **Preset vs Custom** | Push presets harder | More use presets = smoother |

---

- **Dynamic Difficulty** (adjust skeleton HP based on player build)

### **Advanced Features:**

- **Hint System** toggle (for players who need more guidance)
- **Accessibility Mode** with extended tutorials

---

## 📖 **Narrative Context (Lore Hooks)**

### **Mystery Seeds (Planted in FTUE):**

1. **"Your memories foggy"** → Amnesia plotline (who is player?)
2. **"Strange happenings"** → Necromancer arc begins
3. **"Whispers in the night"** → Foreshadow daemon threat
4. **Abbey as sanctuary** → Safe hub, will it remain safe?
5. **Brother Marcus mention** → Future quest giver

### **Tone & Atmosphere:**

- **Dark but not grimdark** - Hope exists, player is a beacon
- **UO-inspired** - No spoon-feeding, player earns victories
- **Mysterious** - Not all answers given, encourage exploration
- **Player-driven** - No chosen one narrative, you ARE the story
