## üìú Maintenance Guidelines

- New tasks: Add directly to the appropriate chunk and link here under ‚ÄúActive Tasks.‚Äù
- Completed tasks: Set to `Status: Done` and move to the bottom ‚ÄúCompleted Tasks‚Äù section. 
- Numbering: Sequential; do not fill gaps‚ÄîIDs remain stable.
- Consistency: Make changes to titles or descriptions in the chunk, not here.

## üîß Task Management

## Critical: Use the templates below to ensure consistency.

## Mark [D] ID: TASK-### for done tasks.

## Mark [A] for active/in-progress tasks.

## Mark [D] for done subtasks.

## Move done tasks to COMPLETED_TASKS.md only if all subtasks are done.

- Task Template (copy-paste for new tasks):


```
- [ ] ID: TASK-###
                  Title: Short descriptive title
                  Status: Proposed / In Progress / Blocked / Done
