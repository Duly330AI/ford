# TASK-M4-AUDIO-03: Advanced Audio Features

**Milestone:** M4 - Nodes, Berufe & Crafting
**Priority:** P1 (Medium)
**Estimated Effort:** 4-5d
**Dependencies:** TASK-M4-AUDIO-01-Audio-Mixer-Engine, TASK-M4-AUDIO-02-Context-Sound-Selection

## Objectives

- Implement 3D audio positioning with distance attenuation, panning, and optional height simulation per SOUND_DESIGN roadmap.
- Add snapshot/state system for reverb, ambience, and combat transitions controllable by scenes and biome triggers.
- Support streaming/looping management for ambient tracks and crossfades between mixer states.
- Provide APIs for tutorial/quest scripts to trigger audio states without exposing low-level mixer details.
- Create tests (headless math-focused) verifying attenuation curves, panning calculations, and snapshot application.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Spatial audio calculations produce deterministic values given positions and parameters, enabling reproducible tests.
- State changes (e.g. entering cavern) apply appropriate reverb/LPF settings per data configuration.
- Mixer handles transitions without audio glitches or resource leaks, as validated in stress tests.
- APIs documented with usage examples for scenes and scripting layers.
- Tests cover fallback behavior when 3D data unavailable, ensuring system degrades gracefully.

## Implementation Notes

- Abstract engine-specific audio handles so tests can mock behavior without audio hardware.
- Store snapshot definitions in `audio/snapshots.json` (with schema) to keep data-driven approach.
- Provide debug tooling to display active snapshot and listener/source positions.
- Coordinate with performance budgeting to ensure audio updates fit frame budget.
